// FROZEN COPY for beatZIG gen3 (cpus/release/gen3/beatZIG.mjs): cpus/learned/policy.mjs at commit 91f6d4f. Do not edit and do not follow changes elsewhere: beatZIG gen3 must play the same for ever.
// The CPU that a forged weight vector makes (forgehammer's smith writes a small cpus/forged-<name>.mjs that calls `learnedCpu` with the weights).
//
// It needs only what the game's own CPU needs: the seat's query and the planner of its own port (queryAction). It does not look ahead and has no sim.
//   flat     every legal move (with its options) is a candidate; each gets z = w·φ(s,a) and the highest is played. One planning call for each entry with options.
//   staged   the legal actions are scored first, before their options are known (weights `entryWeights`); only the best one is planned (one call), and its options are
//            scored (weights `optionWeights`). Two planning calls at most, one more to make the final action.
// When the best is "let the game's own CPU decide" (kinds of action with no candidate of their own), or there is a choice to answer, or nothing to choose from,
// the game's current CPU (view.baseline()) plays.
//
// A move that was accepted and changed nothing the seat can see is not chosen again in the same turn (the same guard as cpus/lookahead.mjs). Two more guards against a
// turn that never ends, the same ones the game's own CPU has: a card is moved (redeploy) or its effect started (activateCardEffect) once a turn, and a turn of more than
// MOVES_PER_TURN moves of this CPU is ended.
