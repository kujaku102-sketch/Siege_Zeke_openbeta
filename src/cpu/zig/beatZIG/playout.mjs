// FROZEN COPY for beatZIG gen3 (cpus/release/gen3/beatZIG.mjs): cpus/lookahead/playout.mjs at commit 91f6d4f. Do not edit and do not follow changes elsewhere: beatZIG gen3 must play the same for ever.
// A state played out: the rest of the seat's own turn, the end of it, the other side's turn and the end of that. Returns the evaluation (for the seat) of the state when that turn ends.
//
//   playout(sim, state, { weights, own, opp, margin }) -> number     (clamped to +-200: a decided game counts as a large number, not as an infinity)
//     own / opp   the most moves played for each side (the seat's: the best by the evaluation after it, while one gains more than `margin`;
//                 the other side's: the worst for the seat, in the same way)
// It reads only what `sim` hands out (states of the decision and the moves on them, src/sim-host.mjs); nothing of the real match.
