// FROZEN COPY for beatZIG gen3 (cpus/release/gen3/beatZIG.mjs): cpus/topk-core.mjs at commit 91f6d4f. Do not edit and do not follow changes elsewhere: beatZIG gen3 must play the same for ever.
// The learned CPU narrows the moves by its own score, and a reader looks at the best few: "the top k by the network, read ahead".
//
//   makeTopk({ k, reader, samples, own, opp }) -> { pick({ sim, built, scores, eligible }) -> the index of the candidate to play, or null (keep the best by score), stats }
//
// The moves of the decision (`eligible`: not blocked by the no-effect memory) are ranked by the learned score; the best `k` that the sim has a call for are read:
//   reader "one"   the state right after the move, evaluated (cpus/lookahead/eval.mjs), averaged over `samples` determinized states      (cheap: about a millisecond a move)
//   reader "deep"  the move played out through the rest of the turn and the other side's turn (cpus/lookahead/playout.mjs; own / opp = the most moves for each side)
// and the one with the best average is played (a tie goes to the better score). If the best by score is a move the sim cannot play (a spell, an effect), it is played as it is:
// there is nothing to compare it with. The reader works on determinized states only, as lookahead does. This file may import only files of this folder.
