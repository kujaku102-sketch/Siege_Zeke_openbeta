// Candidate moves from an ENGINE state, without the runtime's query: no identity index, no reference frame, no reference tokens.
// (A port of SZbattlefield's src/candidates.mjs to this game's own modules; the behaviour is the same, which tests/cpu-lookahead-match.test.js and the bench's compare-shipped check.)
//
// The game's own planner (planningCatalog and the execution / attack planners it uses) asks the engine on a small "planning context"
// ({ state, playerId, viewerSeat, metadata, engine, revision, refFor, resolve, view }). The runtime builds it from a validated authority, an identity index and the reference
// state; here it is built straight from an engine state, and a card is named by its uid instead of a reference token:
//     refFor(card) = card.uid     resolve(uid) = { card, entry: { controllerSeat, ownerSeat, location } }     view(name) = the state itself
// So the candidate set is the game's own, computed on whatever engine state it is given (the real one, or a re-drawn copy).
//
// A card the seat cannot name (the opponent's face-down card) has no name here either (refFor gives null), as in the runtime.
